- some computer programming history
  - F International (Stephanie "Steve" Shirley)

  - other WW2 woman programmers, such as Betty Holberton, who worked on the ENIAC but did not receive credit for their breakthrough in news reports
    - "ENIAC was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945.
