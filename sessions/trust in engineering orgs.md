# Do You Trust Me?: A look at trust, time, and teams

John DeWyze (Shopify)

- systems of trust
  - systems of assumptions that allow us to achieve a minimum level of trust upon first meeting someone or without much context. Enables social harmony and teamwork
  - these systems form the bases/sources of trust:
    - external:
      - culture
        - ex: how to queue up, who has right of way on the street, how much responsibility to give kids
      - experience
        - ex: attachment theory, prior experiences we've had at work
      - contracts
        - legal enforcement
      - titles and certifications
    - internal:
      - teams
      - managers
        - the defenders of trust
      - tech leads
- trust rituals
  - in our jobs: PRs, code review, CI
  - things that build trust in our code & how/why
    - PRs:
      - timely checkpoints
      - group effort
      - knowledge sharing
      - edge cases (test coverage, a good PR writeup)
    - tests:
      - preventing regressions
      - tests as documentation
    - other:
      - CI
      - pairing
      - type systems
      - rubocop
      - code coverage
      - design patterns
      - JIRA et al.
- trust and time
  - our trust rituals are attempts to save us time by preventing trust violations that would require time to rectify... etc. in a circle
- what is trust?
  - trust is about your relationship to the other
  - a form of reliance that can breed betrayal or camaraderie
  - what are the components of trust?
    - predictability
    - competence
    - integrity
    - benevolence
- types of trust violations
